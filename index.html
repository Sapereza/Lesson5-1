            <h2>Marcus Smart, "I love Boston"</h2>
            <p>The Celtics have a notable revalry with the L.A. Lakers. Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the Leprechaun" are Marcus Smart's most famous quote is, "I love Boston. Boston loves me." So, why wouldn't he continue wearing the Green and White for as long as possible? <img style="float:left; margin-right:8px; margin-top:8px" width="250px" height="130px" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Ppb15dzfxJkng8Sfp23LVgHaF7%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=ee4cc286d0a141fea5fc592af4bdf349068e0826e4ef210e2983e3e8f3d74471&ipo=images">Smart will be doing so following Saturday's announcement of his new contract extension with the Celtics.</p>
        
            <h2>All-Defensive First Team</h2>

                <p>The two-time All-Defensive First Team performer spent the first seven years of his career with the franchise, and now he's locked into a contract that would take him well over a decade with the team by the time it comes to an end.</p>

                <p>Smart is entering into the final year of his current contract, which was signed during the 2018 offseason, before his extension kicks in for the
                2022-23 season.
                "There's nowhere else I'd rather
                play and no other fans I'd rather play in front of.
                I love Boston, and Boston loves me," said Smart.
                "We've had some great moments and success in my time here, but there's more to accomplish. I'm ready to put that Celtics jersey back on and get to work out on the Parquet with my teammates."</p>



            <h2>Smart Lockdown Defense</h2>

                <p>Boston had good reason to seek an extension with Smart, and that reason extends far beyond his lockdown defense and his longstanding leadership within the organization. Yes, he is a game-changer at the defensive end who can defend any position at a high level. And yes, he's a leader in the community who cherishes the opportunity to play for this historic franchise. But he's a pretty darn good offensive player, too. To recognize this, one must look past the shooting numbers - although Smart has shot a respectable 34.8 percent from long range over the course of the last three seasons while maxing out at 36.4 percent during the 2018-19 season.</p>
